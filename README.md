MATLAB scripts for modeling synaptic vesicle release probability and failure rates at excitatory synapses, based on experimental data from paired-pulse stimulation protocols.

This repository contains MATLAB code implementing a simple refilling model to analyze synaptic transmission failure patterns. The model calculates the probability of transmission failures at the first and second pulses during paired-pulse stimulation, considering vesicle fusion probability (pv), release site occupancy (pocc), and vesicle replenishment kinetics.
